CONCLUSIONS

	Timers can be adjusted to be slower counting if the preescaler is set to a greater number. This parameter
		needs to be specified in the MX Cube IDE. T6 and T7 are general purpose base time counters. They work with the
		APB1 source clock bus.
	
	The USB base clock feature affects the automatic setting of other peripherals, for instance, the TIMERS.
