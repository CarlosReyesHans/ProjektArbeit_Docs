Configuration of the GUI environments within personal and Hans laptop

Check messages from REnner
Finish really the last presentation as kickoff
	practice it

SETUP a Copy of the repository in GIT LAB from Hans

Continue Working
	High priority
		Translates the logic from example by using the DMA
			Clean up the PWM code. Add a task to configure it. A master TASK
		https://github.com/MaJerle/stm32-ws2812b-tim-pwm-dma
		Study the DMA theory.
		
	
	Low P
		Do tests with the system clock of the processor, to further test the first code

**************************
****		DONE
**************************
	Set the periphereals taking into consideration the lirbaries already existing
	Remote assistance setup correctly but it might be unsecure -can be seen-
		Team viewer is at the end the solution since it can be shared with an external monitor.

********************************

	Nucleo layout has two names for each pin, one refering to the number inside the socket
		the second refers directly to the pin in the MCU pin distribution. Also, in the case of
		PWM @ Analogue pin, it changes. So keep the distribution of pins on-hand.
	
	Even configured automatically through the MX toolm, the peripherals should be initiated with
		a HAL_ instruction. This related to the PWMs.
	
	The PWMs should be connected or wired to a source clock which coincides with the one explained
		in the datashett, namely APB1 or APB2.
		
	The DMA periphereal can be used to update the data from the any other peripheral's register.
		It does not require any CPU resource and works with a FIFO approach.
