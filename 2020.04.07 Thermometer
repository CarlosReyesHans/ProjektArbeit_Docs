FAST STEPS FOR CONFIGURATION OF THE NUCLEO BOARD

NOTES ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DS18B20 1-WIRE TEMP SENSOR WITH STM32

	UPGRADE all the drivers

	-Open the Cube configuration and select the board
	-Look that the debugger is selected in the serial port
	-Check whether the GPIO for the leds ar set correctly
		-There the option to increase the frequency the LED would switch with (whether it is high frequency or not)
		-There are labels assigned
