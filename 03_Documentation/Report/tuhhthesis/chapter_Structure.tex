\chapter{Structure}

This chapter is intended to give you an overview about structuring your work. Note that the following instructions must be understood as a guideline. Of course, the final structure of your thesis report depends on the actual nature of the topic. For instance, the structure of pure theoretical work differs from that of implementational ones. Before starting structuring your work, discuss the actual content, chapters and sections with your supervisor.
