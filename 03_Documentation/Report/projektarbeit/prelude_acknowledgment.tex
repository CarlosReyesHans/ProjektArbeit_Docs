On this outset of the report, I would really like to show my gratitude to 
the management team of Han's Robot Germany GmbH and the Institute smartPORT 
at the Hamburg University of Technology for the
accessibility and confidence in me while developing this Research Project.


Additionally, I also take this opportunity to symbolically express thanks
to all those people that develop by vocation and add up to the open source
projects---specially those who value documentation writing. 
For I find the principles involved---both consciously or unconsciously 
carried out--extremely important in the current
times, even more, as they can be recognized in different fields beyond the 
hardware and software development.
