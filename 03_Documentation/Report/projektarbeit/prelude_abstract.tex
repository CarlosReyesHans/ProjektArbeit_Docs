The abstract of your thesis goes here.
There may be formal requirements on it that can be found in the corresponding examination guidelines (Pr√ºfungsordnung).
If there are none, ask your supervisor.
As a rule of thumb, the abstract should be concise and focused. It is not a shortened introduction to your work.
We also suggest that---if an abstract is not required---only write one if it is really well done.
