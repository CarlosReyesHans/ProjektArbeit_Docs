\chapter{Conclusions and further development}\label{cha:conclusions}

Overall status: Board and basic SOES features ready for further EtherCAT development.

Even though, there have been delays due to the libraries being ported, and channels being noisy before having the PCB working, we're in a stage where we can ensure that the PCB manufactured and ported libraries allow to further develop an EtherCAT compatible application. Therefore, in the following calendar days the following tasks will be priorized to complete the main tasks:

\section{Further development}\label{sec:improve}

**Inserts probably the challenges in the same strutcture as in the implementation part.
