Talk with Jannick

-Advancements within the State Machines
-Timing of tasks (RTOS approach)
	Is it ok the 1ms >> timing constraint for refresh cycles
	
-Altium new design (draft of the 3d model)
	- version 1 and 2 -->> 2nd is the interesting one


port rx and tx and also the led for status


- Affected timing within the schedule 
	Change the priorities
		Real Time Constraints (this week)
		Multiple channel +DMA for 2-4 LED Rings as tasks (this week)
		Soldering of PCB -> LEDs (next week)
		Configuration of SOES Library to be implemented for basic config of device (in 2 weeks)
		Multiple CH of 1-wire interface using UART+DMA as tasks




- Altium design for the capacitive sensor
	- Mosfet design -- Is there any model to base on?
		(Lack of experience)
		-Most of the examples are for high current so it exceed the sizes within the board
		
		






NOTES ABOUT THE TEMPERATURE LIBRARY

Temperature sensor
	Data through 1wire worked for 1 sensor, nevertheless, since it was based on timers and polling
		it (protocol in software) does not match the TASK approach
		New Library will be implemented to address 10 Temperature sensors
			using 1-Wire protocol over uart, timing and interrupts will be handled by HW
Overall result:
