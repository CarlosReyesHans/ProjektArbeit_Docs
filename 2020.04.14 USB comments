USB feature

USB OTG FS/HS - OTG stands for on-the-go, it is though an optional feature.

If implemented, should the EtherCAT device be a periphereal or a host ? Probably a periphereal since it wuould not control anything but only
	deliver information
	Periphereal ----> B device
	Host ----> A device

If implemented it will be restricted to:
	B device (Simplicity), FS (due to speed handle), only one bidirectional pipe line needed
	Less dedicated sram (1.25kB)
	
	
	
////////////QUESTIONS
what is the ADP support which apparently is only available in Type A device?


/////////// TEMPORARY CONCLUSION

This feature is not needed for the development/debugging phase the project is nowadays in.
