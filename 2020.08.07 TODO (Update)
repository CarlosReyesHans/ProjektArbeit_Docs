Activities of today
	1 wire parasite power working for two sensors, continue modifying the code
	Recognisition of the SDO is not working, therefore esi should be download to master manually
	Improve the synchronization with priorities of the temperature task and the soes

	Try to implement the 1 wire protocol with only 1 hardw
	Check the compilation of the driver
	Check whether there are more than one mouse in the house
	Start the report for the funcitonal units.


	Write the feedback to PCBway

	(soes) What are the hooks for?
	(esi) why the data types in the object dictionary are different (32bits) against to those defined in the rxpdo?

2020.08.19
The 1 wire communication
	Bring more temperature sensors
	Look for compatibility
		Either a pull-up resistor is needed or internally can be added
		Set the Tx as Output open-drain with pull-up or pull-down capability
	Implement the low level driver		
	Enable the LWOW_CFG_OSm along with the 4 system functions
			System function template example is available in lwow/src/system/ folder.
			Application must define LWOW_CFG_OS_MUTEX_HANDLE for mutex type. This shall be done in lwow_opts.h file.
	
	


2020.08.17
	Check the bug within the RX and TX Data
		The bug may be related to mailbox
			MAilboxes are matching 100% with ESI
	Check the RXPDO upd
	Who writes the ESCREG_SM2 in soes?? Depending on the task, MCU host writes the RAM or the MASTER

2020.08.14
DONE
	Continuing the tracing back of SM@ mapping
	Re check deeply the Synchronization managers in SOES und match them with ESI
	and send feedback to Microchip (about the AL Control Register)+
	Check the Object dictionary in the Output area.
	
2020.08.13
DONE
	Continue The RXPDO
	Defining the TXPDO with two different objects (minor problems within definitions dec instead of hex)
		Modify the outputs object to be only at index 6000 instead of 6000-6001 not needed
	Check then the pdo mapping to the RXPDO object 0x21 within the ESI file
		
2020.08.11
DONE
	Contact then Microchip
		Asses the specific questions for Microchip in a better way
		Contact only available for microchip by telephone
	Continue from RXPDO 1600 from This has the number of elements of the PDO From Table 74, 5.6.7.4.7 Receive PDO Mapping @ETG1000.6

DONE
	Adapt the SSC tool to LAN9252
	Check the values of the ESC only with beckhoff, poll the AL status with own functions
	Buy the elements for PCB Level shifter
	Drill the table

2020.08.06

DONE

	Possibly problem, there is an offset in the read function of SOES.
	Configuration word was updated and now it is reliable
	Check the straps // Defer depending on the hardware
	Check PCB data


Take away
	How is it written the configuration of 0x8000 if there is no sync M to it? : Because in the options file	
		The virtual addresses are configured.
	MAilbox is not used in SOES???
			Is there a Mailbox already implemented in the LAN9252. YES!! At least the buffer.


Other Day:
PICO CLASP Connectors for usb testing
The cutouts feature in Altium is very practical

Questions to SOES
