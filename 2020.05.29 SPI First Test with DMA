SPI Starting the communications

TODO
Start with the integration of SOES

Set back the brightness and other stuff to Till's Display
Export in a correct way the pdfs of the schematics


DONE
@2020.05.29
	Try to write two register readings only with no dummy inside to force the restart of communication
		This does not apply that easy since it is necessary to wait between fast-read instructions
			The dummy readouts can be though used as delay between write instructions
			
	Incrementing or decrementing header on the instruction
		First attempt did not work, nevertheless it does not affect the reception. There was though an 8 but could be an error.
	Set manually by software the ChipSelect Pin 
		This was not necessary, since the NSS by Hardware is also set to 1 before sending data. 
			The minimum problem is that the initial IDLE state is not working with the Logic Analizer
	Check whether the SPI is having an error or the interruption is just not being called.
		The error was in the NSS line that should not have been set as Hardware controlled
	The user signal 2 and 3 now are used in the spi function
	Run the Polling of the data from the SPI regular instruction
		Change to regular SPI
			This did not work since the SCS was not working properly due to some spikes
			Mainly also for the logic of the LAN9252 that need the dummy bytes to be 1 at each clock over MOSI.

	First tests
	REgister Map found
	Need to fin the set of steps to start the initialization of the Eval Board
	Change the clock source for SPI4 to 20Mhz since read instructions are limited to 30Mhz
		! THIS WAS NOT NEEDED, t


External
This will affect the PWM in the LED section
	The precaler should be adjusted to the desired period
	
The callbacks of the IRQ Handler should be set with a HAL function, not overwritten.



LERNT LESSONS:
	THE NSS HArdware Signal is literally that the Hardware takes care of the toggling of the NSS output
		Therefore it is needed to disable it such that the NSS wire is managed by software
	The HalfCompleted transmission callback for SPI is only available when the DMA is selected
	The directives for extraconfigurations are enabled by definitions USE_HAL_SPI_REGISTER_CALLBACKS == 1U
	While communicating with SPI the dummy bytes should be 0xff, so the Chip Select is not having spikes and the transmission is not interrupted
	The Transmit/Receive SPI+DMA function needs its own callback function TXRXCpltCallback();
	There are some functions in the spi that might be impolemented manually. For example, the SCS that should be 1 once something has been written over the SPI Bus

Software TODO
****************************************************************************************
	Read the technical information about the bus comming from the lan9252
		Dynamic Endianness control << It could be changed, probably
	In a given moment the Contnuos reading out of register will be needed!!
	Init function will be a task but it should be likely only a function.
?R	When should be set back to high the SCS# port??
		Once The interrupt from SPI-DMA finished has been called. Since the SPI READ/WRTITE 
			cycles finish until the data from SPI Device has been received
			
	Implement only the FAST READ Function
	
	


Important Hardware Notes
****************************************************************************************
SCS# is NSS, Communicate when Low >>> Inverse Logic
SPI Mode - The instructions are 8-bit

	READ/WRITE Adressess >> requires 3 bytes, since Addresses are 2-byte long
	14-bit long address, 15 and 14 field specify whether the action is auto-decrementing or incrementing 10b or 01b
		Instructions-Addresses-Data always as MSB (From master to device)
	!	Data is transfered LSB (comming from Device) Litle endian
	Dummy bytes need to be added sometimes
There are a set of instructions for SPI Mode and another for SQI
Only Fast Read will be used


List of instructions for LAN9252
EQIO	Enable the Quad IO
RSTQIO	Disable the QUAD IO

BN	>> SCS	0
RD	>> SCK	1
ON	>> SI	2
YW	>> SO	3

Initialization
***************************************************************************************
BYTE_TEST should be polled Only Single register reads (one per SCSlow)
READY bit should be polled from HW_CFG<< Only when the configuration is done
	As mentioned in 6.3.5 Power Management Registers PMT_CTRL, Ready is the bit 0
	Addresses
	050h Chip ID and Revision (ID_REV)
	064h Byte Order Test Register (BYTE_TEST) DEFAULT VALUE!! 87654321h
	074h Hardware Configuration Register (HW_CFG)

Questions
	How is the high-speed read enable?
	MCU is master
	Hardware NSS Output signal or input?? >> should be output since the MCU is the master
R	What about the prescaler? 
		It should match the maximum transfer rate of the Slave: 80MHz
		Which one is the clock source for the spi? It is APB2, altogether with the SPI1		
	!	APB2 should be 80 due to the SPI communication
			APB2 maximum clock is 80 MHz
	!		The current confi is 40Mbit/s
			The current Full Duplex Master SPI configuration only supports Prescaler =2
				This might be related to the fact that while writing it could use both of the ports to expect 2 bits per clock.
			If the the MCU were a slave device then it could handle at full speed without prescaler
?				Why?
R	Do I need both interruptions the SPI and the DMA?
		The SPI global interruption is for sure needed. The DMAs are alway active as soon as the DMA peripheral is activated for RX and TX
R	How width shhould be the access to the registers in the LAN9252??
		All instructions are 1  byte long, addresses are 14-bit long, info could be 32 bit long.
		
?R	What about the different commands of the SPI? What is the difference betwen the DUAL, serial, Fast, address and other shit?
		Apparently it is possible to be in the SPI mode and still having a connection of 4 wires. Which makes sense, since it could be
			before entering to the SQI mode.
R	What would be the difference SPI/SQI? 	
		SQI is the Quad mode for SPI where 4 bits are sent parallely. The connection needs 2 new wires.
		
		
	Further questions:
	Right know is it needed to make the DMA Buffers Circular/Rounded?
	What about the priorities of the DMA Streams??
		First Streams, then Channels ==>> 8 Channels per Stream
	Difference between the half duplex and full duplex 
		half go an back not at the same time? full both concurrent?
	How different masters can access the same slave??
	
	RTOS questions:
	How to determine the size of the buffer in the tasks?
