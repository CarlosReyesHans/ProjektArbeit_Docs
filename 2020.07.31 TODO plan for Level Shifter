Check MOSFET example from a shield board opensource with mosfets
	https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/transistor/tran_7.html
	

Compare with the proposed solution provided
	Difference was the characteristic curve for Gate charge vs Gate to source Voltage
	
Do the tests with LDO and only one MOSFET (Check 2 )
	Proposal for second version: using either P-Channel MOSFETS
	or N-CHANNEL with pull-down resistors and LOAD resistors to have the signal provided only and not as switching it over the source.
	
	

1 wire pico clasp connector

New plan for Level Shifter
		Level shifter needs another approach (Update using another project as reference)
			Tests: 	Only the Voltage regulator,without MOSFETS (Friday)
					Only one MOSFET, to check whether the MOSFET configuration is working
			
			Changes:	Depending on results, MOSFETs could be changed (Friday-Monday 07.03)
						Connector will be changed to PICO-Clasp
						Board2Board connector as well. 
						Solder Jumper Pads to  bypass elemenst (voltage regulator)
