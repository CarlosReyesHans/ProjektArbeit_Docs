	This contains relevant notes about the commissioning of EtherCAT devices in TwinCAT3.
	Some hints about the IDE are provided as well.
	Some info about Flange Tool Device
	Configuration info of unify wireless ethernet switch

-Local PC acted as a master properly.
-Tested with the ELMO recognition, LAN9252 and the flange tool device
-Variables were updated comming from the flange tool device.
-A chain-like topology was also tested using the LAN9252 and it worked

Notes about the material needed for better EtherCAT testing
/*--------------------------About possible master devices -----------------------------------------*/
As a DIN rail IPC and in conjunction with the TwinCAT software from Beckhoff, the CX50x0 offers the same functionality 
	as large Industrial PCs. In terms of PLC, up to four virtual IEC 61131 CPUs can be programmed with up to four tasks 
	each, with a minimum cycle time of 50 μs. All IEC 61131-3 languages can be used.
For remote programming of some devices (cheap cost) “Windows CE.NET”. In this case, the system is programmed via a laptop 
	or a desktop PC, which is connected to the CX via Ethernet (network or crossover cable). The programs are developed 
	on the laptop with a standard TwinCAT software licence and then loaded into the target device.

/*--------------------------Notes about the Master's features -----------------------------------------*/

The EtherCAT master is a virtual software device
	It is the one that allocates the ETherCAT Telegrams
	Can handle up to 2^16 devices
	Can allocate a second port for cable redundancy ( to have a ring topology)
	Protocol EtherCAT (Master can act as a tunnel switch for ethernet)

/*--------------------------Notes about TwinCAT3 -----------------------------------------*/

(Mapping inputs and outputs)
	Don't forget the At %I* / AT %Q* depending of the nature of the variables.

	AT %I* Is needed at the beginning of the PLC oonfiguration to create and map the IO memory area
		Such that any external device can be linked to the variables.
		
	Work always with the instance of the plc created by default, within it the input and outputs will be mapped.

	Where the ESI are stored

(Software architecture)

What is the ADS?
	 Automation Device Specification >> fieldbus-independent interface that will synchronize the access to ADS devices
	 Twincat System architecture allows individual software modules to act as independent devices.
		Communication between them is done by the ADS interface >> To exchange data
