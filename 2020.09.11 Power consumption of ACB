POWER CONSUMPTION ESTIMATION ACCORDING TO DATASHEET

STM32 --- External clock,

From Table 24. Typical and maximum current consumption in Run mode, code with data processing
running from Flash memory (ART accelerator enabled with prefetch) or RAM(1)

PLL ON,
all peripherals but as inpusts
enabled(3)(4) @ 3.3v for typical
79-80 mA

@ 3.6 for maximal
Max at 85`C
85 - 112 mA
15 Capacitors as in 6.1.6 Power supply scheme



For good working
VDD = 2.7 to 3.6 V(5)


only one or two leds supplying

Vdd usb is considered apart

typica 80mA @ 3.3V >>>> 264mW
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LAN 9252
3.0 - 3.6 V , when the internal regulators are enabled
The core logic works with 1.2 V >>> 1.14-1.26
URRENT CONSUMPTION AND POWER DISSIPATION (REGS. ENABLED)
Divided

CORE
TX MAgnetics (zero if both PHYs are using 100BASE-FX mode)

With power management D0 and traffic
Typical 112.0 82.0  = 194 mA @ 3.3V

Disipation 642 mW
