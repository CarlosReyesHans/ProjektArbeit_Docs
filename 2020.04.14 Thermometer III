RTOS and the Thermometer

///////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////		TEMPERATURE SENSORs III
///////////////////////////////////////////////////



TO-DO

	-tests with the leds
	-set the git

	-implement the reading out of the termometer with RTOS



DONE
	-Install the Project
	-implement the USB UART communication port (propper functions)
	-WOuld it be better to use the USB OTG?? Research a bit about it.
		NO, IT IS NOT NEEDED IN THIS DEVELOPMENT AND DEBUGGING PHASE.
		THE DATA THAT WILL BE COMMUNICATED TO THE PC IS NOT A LARGE AMOUNT. SO IT CAN BE COVERED BY A REGULAR UART PORT.


Constrain

The Skip Rom instruction is being used due to practicity
	Consequences:
		Only one Temperature Sensor can be addressed
		
	Possible improvements
		Add two or more temperature sensors
		the CRC function should be implemented that might take effort.
		
No further configuration of the temperature sensor, it uses the default configuration
	Consequences:
		Only 12 bit conversations @750ms
	Possible improvements
		Add the configuration instructions to enable 9 bit convertions @93.75ms
