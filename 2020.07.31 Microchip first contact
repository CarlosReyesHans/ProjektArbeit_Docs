The following is a brief description of our consult:

As a rough summary, we're doing tests to run an EtherCAT Slave Stack with the LAN9252 and a STM32F446 as host MCU.
The LAN9252's PDI has been already configured to be SPI.
The host MCU is currently able to read data from the directly addressable memory space which contains the System and Status Registers of the ESC.
Whereas the indirectly addressable, namely the EtherCAT core CSR Registers, are also readable by the MCU but the registers corresponding to the DataLink are returning 0x00s.
From Datasheet we have learned that it might be related to a misconfiguration of the configuration words within the EEPROM.

We have designed our own ESI file by following the official Beckhoff's documentation and one of the tools.
So we learnt that the configuration registers are clearly different, e.g, when describing the type of PDI from the ET1100 ASIC.

The following is the simplest configuration word that currently we're using in our ESI file.
                                                                <Eeprom>           
                                                                                <ByteSize>1024</ByteSize>
                                                                                <ConfigData>8000000000000000</ConfigData>
                                                                                <!--Configuration word for all ports enabled, as in SOES example running over linux-->
                                                                                <!--<ConfigData>8002000000000000</ConfigData>-->
                                                                                <!--Bootstrap is disabled since FoE is not present-->
                                                                                <!--<BootStrap>0010800080108000</BootStrap>-->
                                                                </Eeprom>

We're using the simplest possible configuration, only allowing the PDI to work via SPI, all PHY Ports enabled and no DC.
Still we're not able to reach values different than 0x00s from the 0110h-0111h ESC DL Status Register.

We're still on the stage of getting to know the LAN9252 chip, therefore we got motivated to reach you to start a technical communication channel.

Thanks.

Best Regards / Mit freundlichen Grüßen

First contact with Microchip could be for testing the factory configuration.

Configuration needed based on EVB-LAN9252-PICTAIL Add on (All pins available)
	SPI as PDI (LAN9252_EVB_SPI available) -> By default selected
	IRQ (Interrupt Request) Selection -> Disabled. Is it possible?
	HBI High Bandwidth access to CSR Registers -> Disabled

	Configures LAN9252 in SPI with GPIO - 2 port mode.


Test the new configuration word and see whether the DL is changing.
Is AL changing?
What would happen when the AL Flag changes?
--Match the physical connectors with the configuration word.


Note: HBI interface is independent from SQI
