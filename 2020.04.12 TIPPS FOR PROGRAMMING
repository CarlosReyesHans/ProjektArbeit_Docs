TIPPS FOR PROGRAMMING IN C

/////// About dividing the programm

All c files should be self contained
the headers are the only one that have to be included in the main
If there is a private handler pointer created in the main file, it can be passed over to the c files as a second pointer

For example

main.c
	#include second_file.h
	//private pointer
	a_specific_private_Type private_handler;
	
	void main {
		/*This is code*/
			initialization_function(&private_handler);
			while(1){}
		}

second_file.h
	#include main.h
	a_specific_private_Type* this_pointer;
	void initialization_function(a_specific_private_Type* handler);
	void a_function();
	
second_file.c
	void initialization_function(a_specific_private_Type* handler){
		this_pointer = handler;
	}
	void a_function(){
			a=other_function(this_pointer);
	}

This means that the new c file works only if initialized with a valid handler, which does not depend on the main file unless the pointer is passed over.
