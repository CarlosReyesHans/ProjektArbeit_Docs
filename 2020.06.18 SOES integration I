Starting the SOES Integration

********************************************************************************************
@2020.06.18 >> State is not current
This document starts where 2020.04.30 LED WS2812 Migration left

Current issues can be followed here: https://github.com/OpenEtherCATsociety/SOES/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed


//Assumptions
	-No error handling


********************************************************************************************
****		TODO
********************************************************************************************
(Long term)
!	TEST the main interactions with EtherCAT MASTER Monitor (milestone)
		EEPROM write/read works,
		ESC register reading works,
		switching the state machine works (including the OP state),

!		Afterwards:  simple_test example from the SOEM to communicate with EtherCAT master or ECAT Monitor
			Read out the responses and compare the state of the device

********************************************************************************************

//Lern Lessons
	What is the ESC? What does ESC stand for? EtherCAT Slave Controller
	What is CoE? Can over Ethercat
	
	SOES Provides:
		EtherCAT State Machine
		Mailbox Interfaces
		Protocols
			CoE
			FoE + bootstrap template

//TODO
(high priority)
!	Go through the tutorial OpenEtherCATsociety.github.io

retake the SPI configuration from last exercises
	-Link the basic functions to the one of the library

Open a Ethercat Slave Information file ESI files with an xml editor
	Open examples for EtherCAT ESI files


	There is a demo version: https://esd.eu/en/products/ethercat-workbench
			Check the price

Does the CTT work for the SOES that does not support all the features from EtherCAT protocol??
			
(medium priority)
	Look for any trial license for CTT 
	Look for an example within the Simple Open Ethercat Slave Configurator
	Check the threads in the beckhoff forum
	

	Check the library >>> esc_hw.c taken from SOES/soes/hal/rt-kernel-lan9252. 
		replace the starting functions of spi and others withing the library
			what about the "cb_get" and "cb_set" functions.?
	Is the Ethercat Explorer the same as the TwinCAT 3 when adding new devices?
			Explore the documentation of ethercat explorer 

	
!	THEORY: Understanding the mailbox 
	THEORY: what is EoE as feature of SOES??? 
		Ethernet over ECAT
		usage?
		It is also used within the boot state.
	THEORY: Object Dictionaries for EtherCAT slaves??
		
(low priority)
	what is  PDI used for such applications is either SPI? Protocol what?
	Check some examples of wireshark
	

//DONE
The XML editor
	Download a xml editor as a alternative for CTT  https://www.ethercat.org/en/products/D60E3A8E639B44859B2E0F501725703B.htm
				1403,38 EUR or 700 EURO

Ask Jannick about a credential of the EtherCAT Conformance Test Tool
Add the xml tools either to stm32MX or Visual Studio

//Lernt Lessons 
	The soes can work with Run polling, mixed polling/interrupt or interrupt while communicating
		with the LAN9252
	Has libraries for LINUX but not for STM32
	Support for SM Synchronization
	
	About the Slave Designer
		ESI/EEPROM and Object Dictionaries for EtherCAT slaves using the SOES stack (Simple Open EtherCAT Slave).
		ESI (Ethercat slave information file) files can be exporter by EtherCAT Workbench
	
	As soon as the Slave Editor project is created:
		And a SOEM slaveinfo Wireshark can be sent to support[at]rt-labs.com
		The old SlaveEditor was not compatible with LAN9252 due to SPI is configured differently and in conflict with ET1100. 
	
/*----------------------------------ETHERCAT--------------------------------------------*/
	EtherCAT devices have different modes (as IOLINK ones also do) BOOT-operation?-fault?

	
//TODO
Moved to the following day
//DONE
	Check the plugin for eclipse >>> This is not needed since there is a standalone version for the 
		ethercat slave designer and the ethercat device monitor/explorer
	How are we going to work with the SM32?
		read the documentation for starting points
	Download the  EtherCAT Slave Editor
	!	which version of soes should we be using?? The upcoming 3.x will be. the esc_hw driver was updated.
	Install the wireshark to trace the traffic on Ethernet
	start right away with soes
	Check the information within the official information from ecat
	Still look for an example of a Ecat device using the SOES
	Download the EtherCAT Explorer (as soon it is necesary and a EtherCAT slave editor has been created)
		This needs a license with a price about 5k
	check FoE with LAN9252 in issue web page of github
	what is the Foe implementation? Part of the official library of components that a ECAT slave has.
		Apparently is a sort of communication service, similar to the asynchronous comm channel of IO Link.
			Apparently to communicate the errors
			FILE OVER ETHERCAT >>> Write files to ethercat slaves

MAPPING OF THE LED CHANNELS TO HARDWARE CHANNELS
(this is updated after the streams failed to work within the same Timer)
LED1 ---> TIM8 CH1 -> DMA stream X PC6
LED2 ---> TIM3 CH1 -> DMA stream X PB5


OUTPUT OF PWM SIGNALS

FOR SMS PROJECT:

	LEDRING1 CH1 ->	PC6	Available in PCB and Nucle
CH2 ->	PA2 <<<< This is not available in the Nucleo board
CH2 ->	PA3 <<<< This is available and momentary
	LEDRING2 CH2 -> PB5 PC6	Available in PCB and Nucle



FOR BRANCH: LED_dev, LEdv1 project
PWM working in Timer1
CH1 -> PE9
CH2?????

PINOUT OF LED STRIP

LED STRIP 
WH --> GND
GN --> SIGNAL
RD --> VDD
