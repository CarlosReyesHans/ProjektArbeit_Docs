	Dynamic allocation of tasks does not need a name for its buffers, since they're being allocated dynamically
		Is this Heap1?



	RTOS is more stable with periphereals timers instead of the systick clock.
		Why? Apparently some problems with the HAL libraries abstraction
		
		Practice>>
			As developing the first tests of the LED ring, there were two main tasks with normal
				priorities each, and with the logic analyzer it was possible to see both test signals.
				There was unfortunetly an overhead almost of 1.5 us. So the RTOS internal clock was changed
				to the Systick clock @ 180 MHz; nevertheless, it DID NOT work. It even did not schedule
				the tasks.
		Is it really processing @ 160 MHz?
