ALTIUM INTRODUCTION SESSION


Check the libraries from STM32 Nucleo boards for Altium
	Modifying a Library


	Ask Jannick
	>>>		Is there alaready a library from HANS Robot??
	>>		Which one of these if RS Components is not available? Farnell,DigiKey,Arrow,Newark or Mouser?
DONE
	Only BOM
	Continuing checking the Gerber File and other thing
Assembly Material List created
From the Electrical Scheme copy the needed parts into the project


General Notes
	Regardin the F446, it has 3 layers, TOP, MID 1 and BOTTOM layer; moreover, it has 2 GNDs
?	and 1 PWR layer? Is it a path or a continuos GND/PWR layer? 6 Layers in total.
	Source SchDoc and PCB Doc
	
	PLACES TO LOOK FOR MANUFACTURERS COMPONENTS
		snapEDA, ultraLibrarian -->> looking for footprint, symbol and models
		
		
	
TIPS AND TRICKS
	Use the netlink labels for connect between components (upper toolbar for wiring, right click)



Wordlist
TOP PAST MASK ->> Is the GERBER description that has the pads to solder the elements on the top layer.
LAYERS - Each of the surfaces that will have an specific path design to interconnect the 
			elements, and that will be stacked upon each other to save space.
PATHS or VIAS --->> The ways made of copper that are on the PCB
Archs -->> when a path should be modified to be a curve-like path to avoid another element
MCAD --->>> Solidworks Inventor etc, different than ECAD
FOOTPRINT --->> Is the size and pads according to the real dimension of a device/model
SYMBOLS AND 3DMODEL
lentils!!!

To promote me as a co-host
Different against what had been done.

Cloud based collaboration platform (Git-wise)
	Working remotely and colaboration to keep updated between teams
	Controlling project access-->> To avoid send data externaly
		This is actually Version Control
			The Workspace is just a shared directory with the users but also external people
				MAKE Project Available in the right-click menu (git based)
				"Open project" from the ALtium365 Overview
				Modify
				(Other side) Right Click, Version Control =>> Refresh
				Add Comments with a Comment Pannel (As channel communication)
					This are updated on the fly, while changes on the files needs to be done manually
						with the version control menu.
				Show Differences by right Clicking
	Single source of components --->>	Repository or Server
	Example MCAD Collaboration


			Acquire to save it into the workspace
			Annotate schematic quitely?? while adding
			Layer stack management  -->> To have information of layers
			MCAD Ci Designer -->> Push with a comment to stay communicated
				Shape the board >>> 
					SolidWork -->> Altium CoDesigner Tab-->>Pull from the repository as if were a piece
						Modifying the piece and save the changes -->> Push and comment
						(Other side) Then pull from the MCAD Tab .
	Sahre to manufactorer as an iption in the top right corner
		Share on the web =>> The Viewer can actually shows information for each path or element
			SCH, BOM, PCB and 3D
			
	Licensing -->> Standard does not have the revision information after looking for the online info.
