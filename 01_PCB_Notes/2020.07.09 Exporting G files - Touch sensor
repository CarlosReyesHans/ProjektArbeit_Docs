How to export the data for manufacturing


Set the drill configurations
SEt the gerber file configurations
https://www.pcbway.com/helpcenter/technical_support/Generate_gerber_file_from_Altium.html

Create an output gerber file in the project
Create the two different files that are gonna be on the the fabrication outputs
Link  by dragging into the folder structure
Folder structure configure in change, to be exported direct within the root folder
