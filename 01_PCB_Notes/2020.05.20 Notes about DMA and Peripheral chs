For PWM to control the LED Rings

General Purpose with up to 4 channesl for PWM generation
	1 Channel per LED Rings
	Following Timers have their own Stream and Channel of DMA1/2 PWM COMPATIBLE
		This considers the clock bus source
		Considering the Channels @ GPIO
		
		DMA1 CH 5 - S2-X TIM3 	APB1 CLK-Bus

		
		DMA1 CH 3 - S1-X TIM2 	APB1 CLK-Bus all @ PORTA <<  Collides with QUADSPI
		DMA1 CH 6 - S2-X TIM5 	APB1 CLK-Bus all @ PORTA <<  Collides with TIM2
		DMA1 CH 2 - S0-X TIM4	APB1 CLK-Bus all @ PORTB <<  Collides with QUADSPI
		
		The following could be used but they are advance and fit for other apps
		
		DMA2 CH 0-X - SX TIM8 	APB2 CLK-Bus
		DMA2 CH 7-X - SX TIM1	APB2 CLK-Bus
		
		DMA1 CH 7 - S1-X TIM6 	<< NO PWM, BASIC TIMER
		DMA2 CH 3 - S7 QUADSPI
		DMA2 CH 4 - S0-1 SPI4	<< This will be used instead of QUADSPI
		
		
		Conclusion, first implementation:
			One Led-Ring per DMA Channel, we start with TIM3 and try to run the control with
				Streams from the DMA, if not then differents.
				(TIM3 or TIM1 or TIM8)
				(TIM4 AND TIM2/5)
	
			Second implementation:
				3 Led-Rings in one channel + 1 in second channel, using its streams
		
For SPI Devices EtherCAT/IMU
What about the DMA??
	SPI Standard 		4 pins (IMU)
	SPI Dual			4 pins
	SPI QUADSPI			6 pins (EtherCAT)
	
	SPI2	DMA1 CH 0 - S3-4 @PORTC/D	<<
	
	SPI1	DMA2 CH 3 - S0-5 @PORTA		<< DMA Quasi collides with QUADSPI/GPIO collides with TIM3

		Conlusion, firs implementation:
			SPI	for IMU is the SPI2
			SPI for LAN9252 will be QUAD in an optimal implementation, regular implementation will use 
				standard SPI
			
For UARTS GeneralPurpose/1-WIRE
	What about synchronous and asynchronous? The 1-wire half-duplex can be asynchronous
	What about DMA?	All are compatible with DMA
	
	USART2		DMA1	<< Same as UART4/5
	UART4/5		DMA1 CH 4 - S 0,2,4,7
	
	Conclusion
			USART2 is going to be used for the 1-Wire HalfDuplex conexion
			For the General Purposes there are many available, so it is not a problem.

Regarding Clock sources
	It uses the internal clock soource
	no external components << even though it could be not that accurate
