****		NOTES
********************************************************************************************

Word references
SOLDER PASTE - what needs to be put on the usrface of the pcb, on the right amount and position
					Literally this will be soldered.
STENCIL	- stainless steel sheet 
		Could be WITH FRAMEWORK OR WITHOUT IT. 
		
FIDUCIAL MARKER - it is a reference point on pcbs to be proven by a vision system
		Could be half-lasered, lasered or non. Fiducials are inserted during design

Reflow Oven	- One of the methods to solder

BLURRS - manchas, spots

NEEDLE - to fix the clothes/to apply the solder paste

TWEEZERS/PLIERS - To hold the chip

HOT AIR GUN NOZZLE - is the pointy end of a hot air gun, from which the hot air comes out 6mm across

MARKER TYPE FLUX DISPENSER

SOLDERING IRON TIP - now can be used at the end to clean (bridge from two different ) from bad soldering, when it gets between two pins

(High priority)

 Use the soldering iron to clean any bridge created through the soldering process
 Test
	Make cable from external power source
	Make 2 cables for pwms
	Power supply test
	Check how to program with jtag
	Test a blinking led program
	test pwm
	test spi with send receive
	
(External and high priority)

	Continue the second PCB design.
 //DONE
  Paste or hold the pcb onto the stencil with tape or something/glue
 hold it strongly and ppur the soldering paste throughout all thestencil
	to have the right quantity at the right place
 With the tweeyers/pliers, locate the components carefully in the center of their pads
 use the hot air gun tip to heat the pins with the soldering paste till it melts and
	gets exactily between the pad and the pin

	Introduction to lab

 
 /*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
 Material to be used
 
 soldering iron
 microscope
 solder paste with its tool to spread it over the stencil
 tape for holding the pcb on to the stencil
 hot air gun with different tips/ different temperatures?
 Using any holder for the pcb
 Something to pull pins out of the pcbs
