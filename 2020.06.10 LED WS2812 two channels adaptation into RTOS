LED WS2812 two channels adaptation into RTOS

This document starts where 2020.04.30 LED WS2812 Migration left

@2020.06.18	
The events are basically handled by a concurrent task.
Multichannel of pwm+dma is stable for different timers with different cycles. The outputs coincide
	with the channels seleted for the pcb. NO EFFECTS only solid colors.

//Lessons lernt
	Use some physical fuses to bridge different timers to a different pinouts.
	The value that is stored corresponding to the value of the high state of the pwm, which is the effective 
		percentage of pulse is hardcoded in the library, and it is not adjustable to different frequencies.
		The to-compare value is actually in terms of the timer counter not a percentage. 
			this means: If timer counts till 250, then 50% should be 125
			Quick solution -> Change both APBX clock buses to be the same for different timers
	!!		Better solution --> Use prescaler for only one timer such that the APBX correspondent bus can remain 
				with a high frequency.
			>>> This also helps the spi peripheral to work at high speed
			>>>	TIMER connected to APB2 should have a prescaler value of 2
		!!		>>> The prescalers values on the MX configuration wizard are always starting counting from 0, 
					this means, values should be always X-1, where X is the value we want. 
					For example, Count 4 cpu clock tick before having a timer tick, then prescaler = 4-1
						period counter to count 100 times, then  period counter = 100-1
	
//TODO
(high priority)
	Start with the SOES
	Expand the event handler to handle the errors and events
	Check wheter the pins are available in the small version
	Check what jannick said about the report

(medium priority)
	add effects and other colours to the state machine
	check which other features need to be implemented and make a list on the technical specification.

(low priority)
	Plan how would work 4 different channels
	Change the PwM_REfresh_period to os evenFlag
	
	Lern how to link the callbacks using the HAL library, for example for PWM and DMA
		For now the callback functions can be called from the general interruption callback in HAL_STM32_IT file
		          (+) At the end of data transfer HAL_DMA_IRQHandler() function is executed and user can 
              add his own function by customization of function pointer XferCpltCallback and 
              XferErrorCallback (i.e a member of DMA handle structure).
		      htim->hdma[TIM_DMA_ID_CC3]->XferCpltCallback = TIM_DMADelayPulseCplt;
      htim->hdma[TIM_DMA_ID_CC3]->XferHalfCpltCallback = TIM_DMADelayPulseHalfCplt;??
	
//DONE
	Change different colors for different channels (right now is only one color)
	Match or elaborate plan to port the timers to the ones that are gonna be in the physical version
	Update the channels of timer 2 for it to coincide correctly with the pcb design
		LED_RING1 -> Works with timer 8 channel 1 at 160Mhz
		LED_RING2 -> Works with timer 3 channel 2 at 80 Mhz

//LESONS
!!	The output compare preload prevents the signal from bein overlapped or that the following cycle seems shorter everytime a new comparing value is change by the dma

	The PA3 for CH2 was not intended to be so, but the nucleo board does not count with a physical gpio to PA2
	Unfortunately the TIMER2 Channel 1 is not working when stating it in DMA mode.
		After changing to other Timers it does work, but not simultaneously (DMA over different channels even when theyre independent)
		There are also problems with the callbacks that are not bein recognized.
		
	Even though I have already met the solution, the quick solution, I invested though time in trying to run the multichannel alternative
//TODO
	
	(low priority)
	
//DONE
		See the pwm generated. >> Ch1 stucks at one whenever 2 dma streams are set.
		Problem could be de pwm mode, apparently it would let the the different channels to change independently.
		It could be also the DMA configuration, but I have set already the DMA with different priorities and they are in different
			Streams. Nevertheless, it could be that  one dma is handling 2 different events  since it is a shared channel. TMER CH4 and UP.
			
			>>Quick solution, use only one dma per timer >> test the SM so
				
			
			Long term solution: work with these two channels per timer.
	Code the two different callbacks depending on the active channel of the DMA

//Lernt lessons
Variables for event handler will remain with the SM since everything is defined there

//TODO

(Low priority)


//DONE

	Apparently something is missing with the DMA interruption 2
		NOPE, it is a different callback, apparently there is one callback once it has started
		the callback is set within the DMA handler

	Link and debug the dma callbacks for LED1 and LED2, not only the callbacks but the values
	Check why the second buffer to be transmitted appears to be shifted by a byte

	Debugging of update state in LED SM can be emulated with a function that creates a LED EVENT and sets a loose boolean!!
	The update step in LED SM should be called by an error or a notification event, not only notify();

	for all PWM channels, once the a DMA data sending has finished, its callback turns on 
		a flag and then call a function to check whether all of the PWMS have triggered, 
		if yes, then create signal to continue with LED Rings SM

	Change the PWM Channels to match the final distribution of pins
	
	Export the BOM to make the purchases of the devices/elemenst/components
	Start adapting
	Create the function to initialize the PWM handlers of the system and link them to the ones from MX
	We need to set the initial colors before starting the update
	Define the osTimerCallback for LED	
	There could be a race condition writting the DMA and TIMEOUT Event FLAG
	NOT because the timeout embedded in the wait for event OS feature is being used. It is not writting any notification flag
	Continue debugging the multichannel code and run it, so far there is a file which is still calling for the previous WS2812 lib

@2020.06.10


(High priority for overall system)


(Low priority)
	Rework the main structure of the GIT
		One GIT for each Project instead of a root directory
		
DONE
Write the colors of the pinout from the LED Strip
	Test the previous code running as a superloop
	Copy the last state machine with the libraries to the LED branch


********************************************************************************************
****		Lernt lessons
********************************************************************************************

The callback function after the pulse stored in a buffer has been completely sent using the DMA, needs to
	be copied from the HAL library. 
	So it will be called always using an argument as the timer handler. Identification of the channel must be done here

By using the dma with timer, the callback that is used is the one of the timer not the one of the dma.
	!!! Otherwise, the dma is rewritten constantly by the send functions in the timer library

Constraints
The pointers are sent through a function in library configurate lib()

There can be updated only 255 LEDS within a strip

In function startDMA(void), the TIM_CHANNEL should be provided from defines, so the ones that 
are gonna be available will need to be hardcoded: Timer 2 ch1 ch3 and timer 3 chx chx <<< Depending on PCB
