(High priority)
	Continue debugging the multichannel code and run it, so far there is a file which is still calling for the previous WS2812 lib
	Change the PWM Channels to match the final distribution of pins
		for all PWM channels, once the a DMA data sending has finished, its callback turns on 
			a flag and then call a function to check whether all of the PWMS have triggered, 
			if yes, then create signal to continue with LED Rings SM
			
	Export the BOM to make the purchases of the devices/elemenst/components
	Start adapting

(High priority for overall system)
	Check wheter the pins are available in the small version
	Check what jannick said about the report

(Low priority)
	Rework the main structure of the GIT
		One GIT for each Project instead of a root directory
		
DONE
Write the colors of the pinout from the LED Strip
	Test the previous code running as a superloop
	Copy the last state machine with the libraries to the LED branch

Constraints
The pointers are sent through a function in library configurate lib()

There can be updated only 255 LEDS within a strip

In function startDMA(void), the TIM_CHANNEL should be provided from defines, so the ones that 
are gonna be available will need to be hardcoded: Timer 2 ch1 ch3 and timer 3 chx chx <<< Depending on PCB





For Branch LED_dev, LEdv1 project
PWM working in Timer1
CH1 -> PE9

LED STRIP 
WH --> GND
GN --> SIGNAL
RD --> VDD
